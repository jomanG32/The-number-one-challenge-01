HORISEON CODE REFACTOR

The main goal for this challenege is to learn how to refactor the horiseon source code. One of the main goals are to adjust the code that already existed with some new and reformed code that meets the criteria of not changing what the provided code does which is what I made sure to be a necessary key to my work. The layout of the html file document did not follow an semantic before I refactored it so it can basically become a more logical structure, completing the tasks helped me make the css concise more then it oriinally was so it can structure repetitive layouts.
