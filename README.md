# The-number-one-challenge-01

description
The main purpose for this challenge is to learn how to refactor the horiseon source code. one of the goals is to adjust the code that already existed with some new and reformed code without changing what the provided code does which is what I made sure to key on. 
the layout of the html doc did not follow any semantic structures before I refactored it so it could basically become a more logical structure, completing that task helped me make the css concise more then it originally was to basically structure repetitive layouts.
